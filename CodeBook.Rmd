names: reads in the variable names from the features.txt file and stores them.
x_test: reads in the measurement data from the X_test.txt file as a table and adds column names from the names variable.
y_test: reads in the activity data from the y_test.txt file as a table and adds the variable name "activity".
subject_test: reads in the subject data from the subject_test.tx file as a table and adds the variable name "subject".
testdata: combines x_test, y_test, and subject_test into a single table using cbind.
x_train: reads in the measurement data from the X_train.txt file as a table and adds column names from the names variable.
y_train: reads in the activity data from the y_train.txt file as a table and adds the variable name "activity".
subject_train: reads in the subject data from the subject_train.txt file as a table and adds the variable name "subject".
traindata: combines x_train, y_train, and subject_train into a single table using cbind.
data: combines testdata and traindata into a single table using rbind.
tidy_data: The activity, subject, and any column names containing "mean" or "std" are selected from the data data.frame.  Then the             activity column is recoded with the descriptive labels from activity_labels.txt file.
avg_tidy_data: The tidy_data data.frame is grouped by activity and subject.  The measurement variables are then summarized                    using the mean() function.

Below is the features info from the UCI_HAR dataset.  

Feature Selection 


The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
