Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Hardison Everett

This project works with the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset from UCI.  The main purpose of the project is to import the data, combine the test and training data sets into a single table, and then tidy the data for analysis.  Two tidied data.frames are created.  The first, tidy_data, is the test and train data combined into a signle data.frame with subject and activity labels added.  The second data.frame, avg_tidy_data, is the first data.frame grouped by activity and subject and summarized with the mean of the measurements. The script for accomplishing this task is located in the run_analysis.R script.

As stated in the HAR_UCI dataset README, ror each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
